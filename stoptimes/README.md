## Context

The stop times vocabulary is created as a set of URIs to describe the act where a certain vehicle arrives at a certain stop at a certain moment in time and also leaves towards a nextStop and plans to arrive at a certain moment in time.

You can use this vocabulary to:
 * annotate your route planning result documents with URIs for a certain stop time, and its predicates and objects,
 * give an overview of the next stop times (arrivals/departures) in a certain stop_area,

Mind that Stop Times is a very uncompressed specification and doesn't contain ways to describe recurring events (you should use GTFS for that).
