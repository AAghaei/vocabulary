# The open transport vocabularies

The "Open Transport vocabularies" is a collection of vocabularies, which each define a set of URIs, used by the open transport community for various purposes:

1. If within your dataset, you use a certain word, you can link this word to a URI defined within this vocabulary. This way, you have disambiguated your word and your dataset has become semantically interoperable with other datasets using this vocabulary (e.g., by adding [JSON-LD](http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) context or adding [RML mapping files](http://rml.io))
2. You can use these URIs within RDF set-ups to: store data, exchange data within hypermedia APIs, etc.

The URIs defined within the vocabularies are linked to existing vocabularies as much as possible and submitted to the [Linked Open Vocabularies project](http://lov.okfn.org).

## Vocabularies

### docs

In the docs folder you can find a vocabulary for documentation purposes.

### The GTFS vocabulary

### The stop times vocabulary

### Road transport and DATEX2

_TODO: [Datex2](http://www.datex2.eu/) is a specification by [EasyWay](http://www.easyway-its.eu/). It specifies different exchange mechanisms for road transport data. We are **planning** on creating URIs for the data model used in the same way as we did for GTFS._
