# The open transport vocabulary

Goal of this project is to create a common vocabulary to describe all transport systems world-wide.

One of the problems today is that we need to agree on the semantics of certain terms and how they relate to other terms. For instance, a "stop" can mean several things and when several stops from different transport modes and agencies come together, it is difficult to find the semantically correct relation beteen these things. Certainly the use case of a worldwide intermodal route planner suffers from not having a common vocabulary.

Caveat lector: This is not yet another format. This is just agreeing on the words we will use in APIs, data dumps, internal systems, statistics, geospatial services and so on. If a standard already exists, we are adopting the standard's vocabulary and describe it over here.

## Domains this vocabulary covers

* Public transport
- Trains
- Buses
- Ferries
- Subways
- Space transport
- ...
* Private transport
- Parking spots
- Rental services
- Cycling
- Roads
- Traffic
- ...

## Workflow

README files in every folder explain the general semantics, turtle files explain the relation to other things.

Future: The master branch is published on stations.io. The development branch contains unstable changes. When merging development with master, both turtle files and READMEs need to be synced.
