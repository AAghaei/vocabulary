This folder contains the stations.io ontology to describe transport systems from all over the world. It uses the words defined in the vocabulary (markdown files) in this repository and extends it with the right relations.

You can find the .ttl files which contain the ontology in turtle format. You can find a png and svg which visualize these turtle files.
